DATA ENCRYPTION USING EECDH ALGORITHM

Asymmetric cryptography involves a public and private key, where the public key is known to all and the private key is kept a secret.
• Symmetric cryptography involves a shared key, that is known only to the sender and receiver.
• Elliptic curves are graphed by such equations: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b.
• EECDH to prevent MITM attack in cloud computing.
• The proposed EECDH algorithm prevents the MITM attack, in which the communicating owners verify themselves before sharing their keys, using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange for mutual authentication so that privacy is maintained when sharing data on the cloud.
• For signature creation and verification, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is used. Here, all owners verify themselves by using their public and private keys.
• The combination of both identity and attribute-based access policies makes the system robust. To decrypt the message, the data user has to satisfy the attribute-based access policy in addition to having the key. 
The data owner has the right to specify the access policy for the users. And the data owner specifies the access policy in a tree format which consists of a set of attributes related to the data consumer.
