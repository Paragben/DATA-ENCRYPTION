PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed solution is the EECDH Algorithm.
• The basic working involves the multiplication of the private keys of sender and receiver with a point ‘G’ on a curve, which produces their public keys.
• Now, the shared key is derived.
• The ECC point multiplication is done instead of modular multiplications.
• The main concept is:
(a * G) * b = (b * G) * a
• Where ‘a’ is the private key of sender,
• ‘b’ is the private key of receiver,
• ‘G’ is the generator point.
• a*G is the public key of sender,
• b*G is the public key of receiver.
• Now, sender public key * receiver private key = sender private key * receiver public key = secret.
• This shared key is used by both the sender and the receiver.
• The sender uses it for the encryption of the data.
• The receiver uses it for the decryption.
• If the key of the sender matches that of the receiver, then the receiver is allowed to view the data.
• If the shared key does not match, then the receiver is not allowed.
